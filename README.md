# ESG Score Prediction & Sustainable Corporate Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores for companies over time. The aim is to uncover trends, identify outliers, and provide actionable insights for improving sustainability practices across industries and regions.

## Problem Statement
Companies face increasing pressure to operate sustainably while maintaining financial performance. High ESG scores attract investors and demonstrate corporate responsibility. This project explores the relationship between financial metrics, ESG performance, and resource usage to guide companies toward better sustainability practices.

## Approach
- **Data Understanding:** Explored dataset structure, missing values, and data types.
- **Data Preparation:** Filled missing values, handled outliers, created log-transformed and intensity metrics.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses using visualizations such as scatterplots, violin plots, and bubble plots.
- **Insights & Recommendations:** Extracted key trends and proposed actionable sustainability policies.

## Key Insights
1. Distribution of ESG scores and subscores is mostly predictable, with a spike in top Environmental ESG scorers.
2. Company numbers do not vary much by industry or region.
3. Resource intensity varies widely; high ESG companies generally have lower resource intensity ratios.
4. Industry differences are significant; Finance and Technology have higher environmental impacts per revenue.
5. Regional patterns exist; Europe leads, Africa and Middle East lag.
6. High revenue or market cap does not guarantee high ESG.
7. ESG scores have improved over time, though some laggards persist.

## Policy Recommendations
1. Resource Efficiency Incentives for high-impact companies.
2. Industry-Specific ESG Benchmarks with sector targets.
3. Regional Best-Practice Programs for knowledge sharing.
4. Targeted Outlier Engagement for ESG laggards.
5. ESG-Integrated Corporate & Investment Decisions.
